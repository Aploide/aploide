      <div class="fq-questions">
        <details class="mid">
          <summary>What is Eyed Out, and how does it enhance my online privacy?</summary>
          <p>Eyed Out is a privacy-focused browser designed to give you complete control over your online experience. It
            enhances your privacy by blocking trackers, ads, and cookies, ensuring that your browsing data is never
            collected or shared. <br><br>
            With features like web agent spoofing, a built-in proxy, and no search history storage, Eyed Out keeps your
            identity and activities completely private, making it the ideal choice for users who prioritize security and
            anonymity online.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="mid">
          <summary>Why should I use Eyed Out instead of Chrome, Safari, or Firefox?</summary>
          <p>Google and Mozilla have made significant strides in browser technology, but Eyed Out takes privacy and
            performance to the next level. With an optimized engine for faster browsing (based off <a href="https://webkit.org/">WebKit</a>), Eyed Out also ensures your
            privacy with a strict no-tracking policy and built-in ad and tracker blocker. <br><br>
            Unlike other browsers, Eyed Out never collects or shares your data. It's designed for users who prioritize
            security, speed, and control over their online experience.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="mid">
          <summary>Is Eyed Out open source?</summary>
          <p>Eyed Out is not fully open source, but some of its components are open source. By leveraging trusted open
            source technologies alongside proprietary features, Eyed Out provides a balanced combination of transparency
            and innovation. <br><br>
            Some of the components can be seen on our GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/aploide">Aploide</a></p>
        </details>

        <details class="mid">
          <summary>Is Eyed Out truly secure if it's not open source?</summary>
          <p>The idea that "open source = secure" isn't always accurate. For instance, some popular open source browsers
            are backed by companies with vast ad and tracking networks, meaning that even an open source browser can
            contribute to extensive data collection. On the other hand, there are closed-source browsers that prioritize
            privacy and are leaders in privacy-focused technologies. <br><br>

            To truly protect your privacy, consider these two key questions:<br><br>

            <b>Does this browser collect and send data anywhere?</b><br><br>

            <b>How does this browser make money?</b><br><br>

            When it comes to data collection, even open source browsers don't always reveal what happens with the data
            they collect.<br><br>

            Unlike Eyed Out, many modern browsers send a significant amount of data, including your IP address and
            browsing details, to various servers.<br><br>

            Eyed Out, however, operates under a strict no-tracking policy, ensuring that no unexpected data packets are
            sent from your device.<br><br>

            As for the business model, many companies behind free, open source browsers generate revenue through
            advertising and data-related services.<br><br>

            Understanding how a browser makes money is essential in determining whether you can trust it with your
            private information.<br><br>

            With Eyed Out, you can be confident that <b>your data is never part of the equation.</b></p>
        </details>

        <details class="mid">
          <summary>How does this browser make money?</summary>
          <p>Eyed Out generates revenue <b>solely through Eyed Pro</b>, our premium subscription plan. This allows us to keep
            the core features of the browser free for everyone while ensuring that our business model doesn't rely on
            ads, tracking, or data collection. Additionally, we donate 5% of all our revenues to the Arbor Day
            Foundation, supporting environmental sustainability and giving back to the planet.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="mid">
          <summary>What does Eyed Pro offer?</summary>
          <p>Eyed Pro, available for just $5.99 per month or $44.99 per year, provides access to a suite of premium
            features including OtusAI, our advanced AI-powered web search tool. Subscribers also unlock exclusive icons
            and themes. Additionally, a portion of your subscription helps support the Arbor Day Foundation.<br><br>

            We're also actively developing our own search engine and email service, with Eyed Pro revenues funding these
            projects and helping keep the core features of the browser free for all users.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>How does Eyed Out's web agent spoofing protect my online identity?</summary>
          <p>Eyed Out's web agent spoofing feature enhances your online privacy by disguising your browser's identity
            and making it harder for websites to track you.<br><br>

            By altering the browser's user agent string, Eyed Out prevents sites from accurately identifying and
            profiling you based on your device or browser type. This helps protect your personal information and reduces
            the risk of being tracked or fingerprinted online.</p>
